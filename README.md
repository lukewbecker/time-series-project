# Time Series Project

### Author: Luke Becker

## Description: 
The purpose of this project is to answer question posed by our data science team lead at CodeUp in preparation for her board meeting. The topic are to detect and visualize any anomalies in student and instructor access to the CodeUp curriculum for both the web-dev and data science cohorts. Our source data will be the access logs from the CodeUp data server.

In addition, there are these deliverables:
    1. Acquire.py, Prep.py, Wrangle.py, and explore.py files to assist in recreating project.
    2. Juptyer Notebook with exploration and modeling of the data.
    3. Readme with summary of project outline and data dictionary.

## Project Goals

- Discover if by using clustering models and algorithmns, I can produce a model that better predicts the log error of Zillow's Zestimate of property values.
- Utilize Clustering techniques to produce visuals and new features for modeling


## Project Planning

Initial Questions:
- Does number of bedrooms matter to the log error of the Zestimate?
- Does location within the state or county affect overall log error?
- Are there clusters of related features, such as location information that can yield more useful derived features to model on?
- Do these features created from clustering actually produce a better model to predict the Zestimate's log error?



### Hypothesis Tests:

Initial ideas for testing.

##### Features: `latitude` and `logitude`

- H0: The population means for the 4 location clusters are all equal (**no** significant difference)

- Ha: The population means for the 4 location clusters are not equal (there **is** a significant difference)

##### Features: bedroomcnt and bathroomct

- H0: The population means for the 4 rooms clusters are all equal (**no** significant difference)

- Ha: The population means for the 4 rooms clusters are not equal (there **is** a significant difference)
